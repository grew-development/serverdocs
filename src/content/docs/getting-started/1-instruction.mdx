<Aside type="note">
    This repository contains all information and server configurations for my own dedicated server.<br/>
    I myself am not an expert in this area and use this documentation purely for documentation
    reasons for myself and all those who want to build this server.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
    This documentation is not suitable for all use cases and can therefore be adapted or<br/>
    modified according to your needs.
