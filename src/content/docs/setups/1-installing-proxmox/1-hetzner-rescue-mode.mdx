<Aside type="note"> When getting a new server at Hetzner without an installed operating system, it will automatically start in rescue mode.</Aside>
<Aside type="note"> If Hetzner is configured with SSH Keys, you will need to connect via SSH using the key. Otherwise, Hetzner will provide you with a root password for the rescue system when activating rescue mode.
You can add SSH Keys under the Key-Management Section of your Server.</Aside>

If you have already installed a system, proceed as follows to start the rescue mode.

## 1. Accessing Hetzner Robot Panel
    * Login in to your Hetzner-Account
    * Go to [`https://robot.hetzner.com/server`](https://robot.hetzner.com/server)

## 2. Activating Rescue Mode
    * Go to Server in Sidebar
    * Select your Server
    * Go to the `Rescue Tab`
    * Click the Button: 'Activate Rescue System'

## 3. Rebooting your Server
    * Go to `Reset Tab`
    * Select `Trigger automatic hardware reset`
    * Click Button: 'send'

## 4. Connection to the Server via SSH
    * Open Windows Terminal
    * Use the command: `ssh root@<yourIPv4>`

## 5. Loggin
When prompted for a username, enter "root".

    ### 5.1 Using the Password (if applicable): 
        * Go to the `Rescue Tab`
        * Copy the Password
        * Login with the given password in ssh
