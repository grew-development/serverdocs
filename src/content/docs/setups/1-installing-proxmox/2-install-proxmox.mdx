You need to be in Rescue Mode for the following steps.<br/>
And you will need access via SSH to the server.

To install Proxmox on my hetzner server, I used the `installimage` Script provided by hetzner.com<br/>

I used the `Proxmox-Bullseye` version. Because at the time of writing this Debian Bullseye is the most stable version of debian.

* Go into your SSH Console
* Write `installimage`
* Choose `Other > Proxmox[...]-Debian-Bookworm`

In the install config I only **changed the hostname to `proxmox.mydomain.com`**.<br/>
I also changed the disk size, because by default the config does not set the partition sized right.<br/>
I assigned as much as possible and also a bit of swap.

**Example:**
```
HOSTNAME proxmox.grew-development.com
```

**Exaple:**
```
LV  vg0 root    /       ext3    460GiB
LV  vg0 swap    swap    ext3    12GiB 
```

* Save (F2) the Config-file
* Quit (F10) the Config-file
* Confirm the next two confirmations
* Wait until the installation is finished.

If you follow this the `installimage` script will automatically install Proxmox with RAID. And will setup all basic configs to get started on its own.
After installation the server will restart and Proxmox will then be accessible via port 8006 on your IP4-Address.

<Aside type="note">
For your information, don't be alarmed if the installation takes longer than five minutes.<br/>
This is very normal, depending on how fast your server is.
