<Aside type="note">
    I wanted to use VLANs on my server to be able to seperate everything as much as possible even if its maby a bit over the top.
    <br/>I started by configuring a vmbr0 bridge for WAN and internet access for the opnsense later.
    <br/>I also added a vmbr1 bridge for the VLANs later. I used a ovs bridge which you have to install first.

You can now carry out the following steps from your proxmox shell which you can access in the
proxmox webui or in the Windows Terminal/SSH-Console.

```
apt update
apt upgrade
apt install openvswitch-switch
```
If you want to copy my config look her <a target="_blank" href="../../configs/proxmox/etc-network-interfaces">`/etc/network/interfaces`</a>. There you will find my exact config to copy.<br/>
But remember the values you read beforehand You will have to adjust your ip4 and gateway to the ones given to you from proxmox.<br/>
To copy this config just use `vim` or `nano`<br/>

```
nano /etc/network/interfaces
reboot
```
<Aside type="note">
    **NANO**<br/>
    You can safe the changes with `ctlr + o` and exit the file with `ctlr + x`<br/>

    **VIM**<br/>
    You can safe the changes with `press Esc key | Type ":w" | press ENTER key` and exit the file with `press Esc key | Type ":q" | press ENTER key`

    MAKE SURE THE VALUES ARE CORRECT OTHERWISE YOU WILL NOT REACH THE SERVER ON THE
    IP ANYMORE (HETZNER RESCUE MODE TO YOUR HELP)
