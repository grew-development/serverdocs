First of all, you should reset the root password for your Proxmox server.<br/>
If you are no longer connected via SSH console, you must reconnect to the server via SSH.

## Changing Proxmox password
* Open SSh-console
* write `passwd`
* Write your new password when prompted.
* Repeat your new password
* Done

## Open Proxmox-WebUI
Open your Browser and go to the URL: `https://<yourIP4>:8006`.
You may have to accept the risk, as your SSL certificate is currently Self Signed and the browser just doesn't trust them by default.
