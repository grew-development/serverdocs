## Configuring Trunks
You will have to add a new trunk each time you want to connect a new VLAN to the Docker CT.
For that its simmelar to the OPNSense setup.
run the Commands in the proxmox-shell. You can edit the config with `vim` or `nano`.
```
nano /etc/pve/lxc/101.conf
```

We will need to edit the line starting with `net0`: and add all your VLANS as trunks `trunks=102;103;...`
It should look like this after that
```
net0: name=vlan0,bridge=vmbr1,firewall=1,hwaddr=BC:24:11:1C:45:19,type=veth,trunks=102;103;104;110;111
```

I added 102-104 and 110, 111 for now, because I will need them for sure.<br/>
Reboot the dockersoft-container.

<Aside type="caution">
Make sure to add new VLANs to trunks when needing a new VLAN
