## Configuring Trunks
You will have to add a new trunk each time you want to connect a new VLAN to the Docker CT.
For that its simmelar to the OPNSense setup.
run the Commands in the proxmox-shell. You can edit the config with `vim` or `nano`.
```
nano /etc/pve/lxc/101.conf
```

We will need to edit the line starting with `net0`: and add all your VLANS as trunks `trunks=102;103;...`
It should look like this after that
```
net0: name=vlan0,bridge=vmbr1,firewall=1,hwaddr=BC:24:11:1C:45:19,type=veth,trunks=102;103;104;110;111
```

I added 102-104 and 110, 111 for now, because I will need them for sure.<br/>
Reboot the dockersoft-container.

<Aside type="caution">
Make sure to add new VLANs to trunks when needing a new VLAN

## Create VLAN in OPNsense
### Connecting to OPNsense-WebUI
You can connect to OPNSense via a SSH-Tunnel.

* Open Windows Terminal
* Use the command: `ssh root@<yourIP4> -L 443:<WAN_IP4>:443`

This will open up a tunnel. After that you should be able to connect via `https://localhost`.
To setup everything important I recommend running the setup wizard. It will configure some important things needed for further configuration

<Aside>
If you cannot reach the OPNSense make sure that the firewall is disabled in OPNSense.

You can do so from Proxmox in the OPNSense console by selecting option 8.<br/>
In the OPNSense console you can then type `pfctl -d` to disable the firewall.<br/>
It will reenable after each apply you do inside of the OPNSense WebUI or by running `pfctl -e`.
All Rules will be disabled when the firewall is disabled. If every you can’t reach OPNSense on the
tunnel or you need to trubbleshoot make sure to disable the firewall again.<br/>

THIS WILL HAPPEN A LOT DURING SETUP!
</Aside>

### Create Interface
* Go to `Interfaces > Other Types > VLAN`
* Add VLAN by clicking the plus-button
* Enter the following values
* Hit 'safe' and then 'apply'

#### Interfacesetting
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Edit VLAN">
        Device          -   vlan0.102 ( vlan0.\<VLAN_ID> )<br/>
        Parent          -   vtnet1<br/>
        VLAN tag        -   102<br/>
        VLAN priority   -   Default<br/>
        Description     -   102_proxy ( \<VLAN_ID>_\<NAME_FOR_THE_VLAN> )<br/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Adding the new interface
* Go to `Interfaces > Assignments`
* Select your new VLAN in "Assign a new interface" you just create
* Provide a description (Use the same description as above - Example: 102_proxy)
* Click the `Add`-button

### Enable of the new interface
* Go to `Interfaces > [Your Interface]` (example proxy: 102_proxy)
* Enable the Interface
* Select under `Generic configuration` the "IPv4 Configuration Type" from "none" to "Static IPv4"
* Enter the IP address for the Proxmox Gateway under “Static IPv4 configuration” (example proxy: 10.1.2.1)
* Choose your Subnet to 24
* Hit Safe and Apply changes

### Update RFC1918-Rules
* Go to `Firewall > Aliases`
* Edit the `RFC1918-rule` by clicking the pen
* Add content `__opt3_network` (In future all those beginning with __, but the number can be different)
* Hit Safe and Apply

### Add Rule RFC1918 to Interface
We will use RFC1918 to configure firewall rules for internet access.
If you want to give internet access to a vlan but still restrict access to all other internal IPs
you can do that with the help of a firewall rule that accepts all connections except if they target RFC1918.

* Go to "Firewall > Rules"
* Select the VLAN you want to grant internet access
* Create a new rule if it doesnt already exist by hitting the plus.

We want to allow everything except if the destination is RFC1918.

* Enable Destination / Invert.
* Select RFC1918 as a destination
* Select the Category (optional)
* Safe and Apply Changes

### Add Alias for proxy
* Go to `Firewall > Aliases`
* Hit the Plus-Symbol
* Enter the name `proxy`
* Choose type as `host(s)`
* Selected content `10.1.2.2`
* Hit Safe and Apply
