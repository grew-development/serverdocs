<Aside type="note">
Preparation for the creation of a proxy.<br/>
In any case, it is safer and advisable to do this via the tailscale IPs to ensure your own security.

I use my tailscale IPs for the next steps, but you can still use the addresses from your public IP.<br/>
I.e. it is best to read my instructions correctly, but I try to put the alternative IP's in brackets.

## Create API token (Cloudflare)
To create an API token there is an official guide from Cloudflare.<br/>
Nevertheless, I will describe how I proceeded.

/>

* Open the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens/)
* Go to `My Profile > API Tokens`
* Select `Create Token`
* Select the Template `Edit zone DNS`
* Edit the token name to describe why or how the token is used.<br/>I name it "Proxy SSL Token"

* Modify the Permissions to `Zone | DNS | Edit`
* Modify the Zone Resources to `Include' | All zones`
* Click `Continue to summary`
* Click `Create Token` to generate the token’s secret.
* Copy the secret-token to a secure place
