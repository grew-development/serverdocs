import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="danger">
To access the interface you would have to open the 'public port 81'.<br/>
However, you can bypass this if you have activated and set up tailscale in your OPNsense beforehand.

## Create temporary firewall rule
### Connecting to OPNsense-WebUI
We would like to create a temporary firewall rule to access the WebUI via port 81.
To do this, first open opnsense via your SSH-Tunnel.

* Open Windows Terminal
* Use the command: `ssh root@<yourIP4> -L 443:<WAN_IP4>:9443`

This will open up a tunnel. After that you should be able to connect via `https://localhost`. To setup everything important I recommend running the setup wizard.<br/>
It will configure some important things needed for further configuration

<Aside>
    If you cannot reach the OPNSense make sure that the firewall is disabled in OPNSense.

    You can do so from Proxmox in the OPNSense console by selecting option 8.<br/>
    In the OPNSense console you can then type `pfctl -d` to disable the firewall.<br/>
    It will reenable after each apply you do inside of the OPNSense WebUI or by running `pfctl -e`.<br/>
    All Rules will be disabled when the firewall is disabled.<br/>
    If every you can’t reach OPNSense on the tunnel or you need to trubbleshoot make sure to disable the firewall again.<br/>

    THIS WILL HAPPEN A LOT DURING SETUP!
</Aside>

### Create NAT-Rule
* Go to `Firewall > NAT > Port Forward`
* Add Rule by clicking the plus-button
* Enter the following values
* Hit 'safe' and then 'apply'

#### NATrule-Settings
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="tailscale port">
        Interface               -   TAILSCALE<br/>
        Destination / Invert    -   false<br/>
        Destination             -   TAILSCALE_ADDRESS<br/>
        Destination port from   -   (other) 81<br/>
        Destination port to     -   (other) 81<br/>
        Redirect Target IP      -   Proxy-Alias (IP: 10.1.2.2)<br/>
        Redirect Target Port    -   (other) 81<br/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="public port">
        Interface               -   WAN<br/>
        Destination / Invert    -   false<br/>
        Destination             -   WAN_ADDRESS<br/>
        Destination port from   -   (other) 81<br/>
        Destination port to     -   (other) 81<br/>
        Redirect Target IP      -   Proxy-Alias (IP: 10.1.2.2)<br/>
        Redirect Target Port    -   (other) 81<br/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Open the webinterface
<Aside type="note">
    If you cannot reach the OPNSense make sure that the firewall is enable in OPNSense.

    You can do so from Proxmox in the OPNSense console by selecting option 8.<br/>
    In the OPNSense console you can then type `pfctl -e` to enable the firewall.<br/>

### via tailscale ip (my choice)
Now you can access the web interface of your proxy manager with your browser.

<Aside type="caution">
    To continue with this step, make sure you have installed and turned on your Tailsclae on the OPNsense.
    If not go to [OPNsende > Tailscale Installer](../2-installing-opnsense/8-tailscale-installer).

### via public ip
Now you can access the web interface of your proxy manager with your browser.

```

## Login into webinterface
Please use the following data for the first login.<br/>
You will then be asked to change your userinformation and the password, but I recommend filling this out.

Save and apply everything
