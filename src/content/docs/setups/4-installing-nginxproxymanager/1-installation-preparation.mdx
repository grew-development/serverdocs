description: Installation preparation for my Proxymanager
---

NGINX is my proxy manager with which I can make some cool settings.
But first we have to make preparations for the installation.

Later we will install dockge as a container manager.<br/>
To make things easier for later we can already create all files for dockge.

For example what I like to do is create `/opt/stacks` for dockge with `mkdir /opt/stacks`.
I then execute this command in the console of the Dockersoft CT.

I also like to add it to my .bashrc with `nano ~/.bashrc` and adding `cd /opt/stacks`.

After that, reboot the Container.
