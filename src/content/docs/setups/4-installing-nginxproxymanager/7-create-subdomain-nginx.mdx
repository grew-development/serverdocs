import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

First, we want to build a proxy host for our NGINX manager so that we can access our manager via the subdomain `proxy.yourdomain.com`.

We have already made some settings in advance, including forwarding ports 443 and port 80 to our proxy.

And now we have to do everything else for the creation.
So let's get started

## Create DNS Record (Domain-Provider)
First, we create a DNS record for our first subdomain with our website provider.<br/>
Since I run my domain via Cloudflare, I will also create my first DNS record there.

* Open your DNS-Record-Area
* Create the record with the following values
* Save and Apply

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Type">
        A
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Name">
        proxy<br/>
        (your subdomain for the proxy manager like proxy.yourdomain.com)
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="IPv4-Address">
        TAILSCALE-ADRESS from OPNsense or your public IP
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Proxy Status">
        False   -   If you use Tailscaleadress<br/>
        True    -   If you use Public IP
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="TTL">
        Auto or 120 Seconds
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Open and Login to the webinterface
<Aside type="note">
If you cannot reach the OPNSense make sure that the firewall is enable in OPNSense.

You can do so from Proxmox in the OPNSense console by selecting option 8.<br/>
In the OPNSense console you can then type `pfctl -e` to enable the firewall.<br/>
</Aside>

### via tailscale ip (my choice)
Now you can access the web interface of your proxy manager with your browser.
<Aside type="caution">
To continue with this step, make sure you have installed and turned on your Tailsclae on the OPNsense.
If not go to [OPNsende > Tailscale Installer](../2-installing-opnsense/8-tailscale-installer).
</Aside>
```
http://opnsense_tailscale_ip:81
```

### via public ip
Now you can access the web interface of your proxy manager with your browser.
```
http://yourip:81
```

## Create Proxy host
* Go to `Hosts > Proxy Hosts`
* Click green `Add Proxy Host`-Button
* Now enter the following values
* Click `Safe`-button

### Proxysettings
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Details-Tab">
        Domain Names            -   proxy.yourdomain.com<br/>
        Scheme                  -   http<br/>
        Forward Hostname / IP   -   127.0.0.1 or localhost<br/>
        Forward port            -   81<br/>
        Cache Assets            -   false<br/>
        Block Common Exploits   -   false<br/>
        Websockets Support      -   true<br/>
        Access List             -   "Publicly Accessible"
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Custom locations-Tab">
        Change nothing
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="SSL-Tab">
        SSL Certificate     -   "Request a new SSL Certificate"<br/>
        Force SSL           -   true<br/>
        HTTP/2 Support      -   true<br/>
        HSTS Enabled        -   false<br/>
        HSTS Subdomains     -   false<br/>
        Use a DNS Challenge -   true (only if you use tailscale)<br/>
        * DNS Provider > Cloudflare
        * Credentials File Content > Change the token to your token
        * Propagation Seconds > empty

        Email Address       -   Your E-Mailadress<br/>
        Terms of Service    -   true<br/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Advanced-Tab">
        Change nothing
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If the host you have just created has the `status "Online"`, everything has worked and you can reach your proxy manager at `proxy.yourdomain.com`.
Now we should delete the temporarily created NAT rule from port 81.

## Connecting to OPNsense-WebUI
We would like to create a temporary firewall rule to access the WebUI via port 81.
To do this, first open opnsense via your SSH-Tunnel.

* Open Windows Terminal
* Use the command: `ssh root@<yourIP4> -L 443:<WAN_IP4>:9443`

This will open up a tunnel. After that you should be able to connect via `https://localhost`.
To setup everything important I recommend running the setup wizard. It will configure some important things needed for further configuration

<Aside>
If you cannot reach the OPNSense make sure that the firewall is disabled in OPNSense.

You can do so from Proxmox in the OPNSense console by selecting option 8.<br/>
In the OPNSense console you can then type `pfctl -d` to disable the firewall.<br/>
It will reenable after each apply you do inside of the OPNSense WebUI or by running `pfctl -e`.
All Rules will be disabled when the firewall is disabled. If every you can’t reach OPNSense on the
tunnel or you need to trubbleshoot make sure to disable the firewall again.<br/>

THIS WILL HAPPEN A LOT DURING SETUP!
</Aside>

### Delete NAT-Rule with Port 81
* Go to `Firewall > NAT > Port Forward`
* Delete the Rule by clicking the Trash-button
* Hit 'Yes' and then 'apply'

<Aside type="tip">
Now I will create more subdomains, for example for my Proxmox, opnsense and Dockge.
However, I have created a separate area for this.
You can find this area under [`Subdomains`](../../subdomains/subdomain-opnsense).
