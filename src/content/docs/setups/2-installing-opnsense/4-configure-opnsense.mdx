import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Next we need to configure the WAN for OPNSense in order to be able to access the internet and the WebUI of the Opnsense.

For that we will need to go into the Shell of our OPNSense VM.

From there you will need to login with root if you didn’t already.

You will now have multiple options available. We want to start by assigning our interfaces correctly.<br/>
For that we will select option `1. Assign interfaces`

* Do you want to configure LAGGS now? `No`
* Do you want to configure VLANs now? `No` (not now)
* Enter the WAN interface name: `vtnet0`
* Enter the LAN interface name: (Enter to skip)
* Enter the Optional interface 1 name: (Enter to skip)
* WAN -> vtnet0 Do you want to proceed? `Yes`

Next we want to assign the right IP address to the WAN interface.<br/>
In the etc/network/interfaces config we already configured a redirect to an IP address.<br/>
We will use this IP address as our OPNSense IP.

For that we will now have to select option `2. Set interface IP address`.<br/>
I use the following values within the setting:

<Aside>
This is only if you are using a setup with a singular IPv4.<br/>
If you are using two you will need to use `10.10.1.1` as your WAN IPv4 and<br/>
`10.10.1.0` as your WAN IPv4 gateway.<br/>
Here we will only add the first WAN the second WAN we can later add in the WebUI
</Aside>


* Enter the number of the interface to configure: (Select your WAN interface)
* Configure IPv4 address WAN interface via DHCP? `No`
* Enter the new WAN IPv4 address: `10.10.10.1` (as configured in interfaces in proxmox)
* Enter the new WAN IPv4 subnet bit count (1 to 32): `31`
* For a WAN, enter the new WAN IPv4 upstream gateway address: `10.10.10.0`
* Do you want to use the gateway as the IPv4 name server, too? `No`
* Enter the IPv4 name server: `1.1.1.1` (Cloudflare) or `8.8.8.8` (Google)

<Aside>
If you want to use IPv6, you will need to configure IPv6 in your etc/network/interfaces config and<br/>
also configure IPv6 in OPNSense. You can still do so later from the OPNSense WebUI.<br/>
I did not use IPv6 for my setup.
</Aside>

* Configure IPv6 address WAN interface via DHCP6? `No`
* Enter the new WAN IPv6 address: (Enter to skip)
* Do you want to change the web GUI protocol from HTTPS to HTTP? `No`
* Do you want to generate a new self-signed web GUI certificate? `Yes`
* Restore web GUI access defaults? `Yes`
