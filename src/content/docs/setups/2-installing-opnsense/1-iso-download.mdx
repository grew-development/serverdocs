The best way to install OPNSense is the direct download the iso-file via `wget`.<br/>
To do this, you should now perform the following steps:

* Go to `https://opnsense.org/download/`
* Select your System architecture (my architecture: amd64)
* Select the image type to `dvd`
* Search your nearest and the best Mirror Location (my location: Germany/LeaseWeb)
* Right click on the Download-button and copy the Link-Address

Now follow the steps below to download and unzip the ISO file.<br/>
You can now carry out the following steps from your proxmox shell which you can access in the proxmox webui.

```
cd /var/lib/vz/template/iso
wget <LINK_FROM_YOUR_CLIPBOARD>
bzip2 -d <YOUR_FILENAME.bz2>
```

After that you should have a OPNSense install ISO `OPNsense-{version}-dvd-amd64.iso`<br/>
If the archive with the ending .bz2 still exists, you should delete it

```
rm -r <YOUR_FILENAME.bz2> 
```
