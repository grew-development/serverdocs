title: RFC1918 Alias

description: Create the RFC1918-Rule with alias
---

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Next, I create an alias for RFC1918. <br/>
RFC1918 normally stands for all private IP addresses in your local network.

In my setup, this alias is used for rules that allow internet access for a specific VLAN, except for
anything inside RFC1918. This makes it much easier to create internet access rules for the VLANs.

* Go to `Firewall > Aliases`
* Hit the Plus-Symbol
* Enter the name `RFC1918`
* Choose type as `networks(s)`
* Selected content `__wan_network__` (In future all those beginning with __)

<Aside type="caution">
Make sure to update this alias every time you add a new network/interface to your OPNSense
otherwise VLAN’s could access devices on the connected network.
