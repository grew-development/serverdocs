import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

We change the default port of OPNsense to a custom one,<br/>
as we will then forward everything that comes into our WAN input directly to our proxy manager

* Go to `System > Settings > Administration`
* Change the TCP port to `9443`
* Hit 'safe'


## Reconnect to WebUI
* Open Windows Terminal
* Use the command: `ssh root@<yourIP4> -L 443:<WAN_IP4>:9443`

This will open up a tunnel. After that you should be able to reconnect via `https://localhost`.
<Aside type="note">
If you cannot reach the OPNSense make sure that the firewall is disabled in OPNSense.

You can do so from Proxmox in the OPNSense console by selecting option 8.<br/>
In the OPNSense console you can then type `pfctl -d` to disable the firewall.<br/>
It will reenable after each apply you do inside of the OPNSense WebUI or by running `pfctl -e`.
All Rules will be disabled when the firewall is disabled. If every you can’t reach OPNSense on the
tunnel or you need to trubbleshoot make sure to disable the firewall again.<br/>

THIS WILL HAPPEN A LOT DURING SETUP!

## Create NAT-Rule
We now also forward the default port from my WAN-Address here.
* Go to `Firewall > NAT > Port Forward`
* Add Rule by clicking the plus-button
* Enter the following values
* Hit 'safe' and then 'apply'
