import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Next I update OPNSense and install the QEMU Guest Agent.<br/>
This is important because otherwise proxmox cannot shutdown the OPNSense when proxmox needs to reboot.<br/>
You also would not be able to stop OPNSense from Proxmox manually or restart it if the QEMU Guest Agent is not installed.

## Updating OPNSense
<Aside type="caution">
    If the following steps do not work, or if nothing is displayed under `System > Firmware > Status` after five minutes, you should check your Internet connection.<br/>
    It may be that your OPNSense does not have Internet access to update the system.<br/>

    Then it is best to check your Internet settings that you have set under [Configure OPNSense](/setups/2-installing-opnsense/4-configure-opnsense).

</Aside>


You should regullary update your OPNSense because it handels most of your server traffic and its the most vulnerable point of your server.<br/>
I would suggest running updates at least once a week or if you dont run critical stuff on your server atleast once in a month.

* Go to `System > Firmware > Status`
* Should be able to `Check for updates` (It should redirect you to the `Update-Tab`.)
* Scroll down and click `Update`#
* Confirm by clicking `Ok`

After that OPNSense should automatically download and install the updates. Sometimes OPNSense will need to restart after certain updates.<br/>
Sometimes it will update the packages inplace. If you are using localhost to connect via SSH Tunnel you may need to disable the firewall after that again.

## Installing QEMU-Guest-Agent
We need to install the QEMU-Agent Plugin to OPNSense.<br/>
As I already mentioned we need this plugin for the communication between our server (Proxmox) and opnsense.

To install the QEMU Quest Agent you need to head to the Plugins section `System > Firmware > Plugins`.<br/>
There you will have to search for os-qemu-guest-agent and click the plus icon on the right.

This will install the QEMU-Guest-Agent.

In some cases the QEMU-Guest-Agent will not start automatically. You can check if it is running under Lobby/Dashbaord.<br/>
You should be able to see the QEMU-Guest-Agent in the Services Section. If it has a red stopped icon you can click the play button to start it.<br/>
After that the icon should turn green, indicating that the QEMU-Guest-Agent is running.

Congratulations you have now installed opnsense on your server and configured the necessary things for further use!
