import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Start by creating a new VM in proxmox.<br/>
I used VM ID 100 to display it at the top because its the first entry point for every request to the server.<br/>
Later I also assign VLAN100 to the opnsense.

Click on the `Create VM` button above and set the VM with the following values.<br/>
I left all values that were not specified as they were or were not specified at the time of creation.

<Aside type="tip">
    Activate Advanced Mode at the bottom of the window

### VM Settingvalues
After creating the VM we will add the vlan network aswell.<br/>
Now confirm the whole thing in the `Confirm area` and click on the `finish` button.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="General">
        Node            -   proxmox<br/>
        VM ID           -   100<br/>
        Name            -   OPNsense<br/>
        Start at boot  -   true [Advanced Mode]<br/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="OS">
        ISO image   -   Choose your iso here<br/>
        Qemu Agent  -   True (That way proxmox qemu can tell the vm to start, stop and restart when the qemu agent is installed)<br/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Disk">
        Disk size   -   10-30 GB (depends on the amount of firewall rules, configs and plugins)<br/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="CPU">
        Cores           -   2-4 (depends on the network traffic)<br/>
        Extra CPU Flags -   aes > on<br/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Memory">
        Memory  -   3GB-6GB (depends on the network traffic and rules and plugins)<br/>
        <Aside type="note">
            You must enter this value in MiB, i.e. 6144 MiB for 6GB
        </Aside>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Network">
        Bridge      -   vmbr0 (WAN)<br/>
        Multiqueue  -   8 (For better performance)<br/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Post-Create
<Aside type="note">
    This is only if you are using a setup with a singular IPv4.<br/>
    If you are using two, vmbr1 will be your second WAN and you will have to add it the same way as the first WAN.<br/>
    Then you can follow the next steps with vmbr2 which will then be your VLAN interface.
</Aside>

We will need to add the VLAN Network now aswell.<br/>
* Select the OPNsense VM in Proxmox Web Interface
* Go to the `Hardware`-Settings
* Click `Add` and Select `Network-Device`

Make sure `Advanced` is enabled again to see all settings.

### Network Device Settingvalues
* Bridge      -   vmbr1 (VLAN-Network)<br/>
* VLAN Tag    -   100 (The same as the VM ID)<br/>
* Multiqueue  -   8 (For better performance)<br/>

## Trunking
Now we also need to tell Proxmox, that Opnsense acts as a trunk in the VLAN-NET.<br/>
(If you don't know what a trunk is look it up!)

### Configuration
To configure Opnsense as a trunk in the VLAN-NET, follow these steps:
1. Edit VM Configuration: Access the Proxmox shell and navigate to the VM configuration directory.
    ```
    nano /etc/pve/qemu-server/100.conf
    ```
2. Update net1 Configuration: Locate the configuration line for net1 in the file and append trunks=1-4095 to it. After the modification, the line should resemble:
    ```
    net1: virtio=92:39:CF:F0:F9:A8,bridge=vmbr1,firewall=1,queues=8,tag=100,trunks=1-4095
    ```
This ensures Opnsense functions as a trunk in the VLAN-NET.
