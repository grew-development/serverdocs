Once you have made all the network settings, we can now start our container with dockge.<br/>
To do this, we first go to the folder in which our docker-compose-yml file is in using the dockersoftware-console.

```
cd /opt/stacks/dockge/
```

To start the container now, use the following command:
```
docker compose up -d
```

<Aside type="note">
**Explanation of the command**<br/>
`docker` is the app<br/>
`compose` you address the container<br/>
`up` you start it<br/>
`-d` means that you do it covertly as detached<br/>

If you want to know which container is currently active in docker, use Command: `docker ps`<br/>
If you want to see the logs for a container, go to the folder and run the command: `docker compose logs`

## Create Subdomain
I have moved this section to the [`Subdomains`](../../subdomains/subdomain-dockge).<br/>
You need this step to continue with the setup as well as to log in at all.
