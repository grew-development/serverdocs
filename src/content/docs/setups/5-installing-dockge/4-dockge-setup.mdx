import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Login into Web-WebUI
After creating your subdomain, you can now connect to the web interface.
* Open `dockge.yourdomain.com`

## Create Admin-Account
After the page has loaded, you can create an admin account.<br/>

To do this, enter your username, password and repeat your password.<br/>
Then click on the create button.

Congratulations, the main settings are done.
But now we need to make some more settings


### My assignment of the account
* Username: I use `root`, but you can use the first letter of first name, then full surname separated by a period like `j.doe`
* Password: Individual, 32-digit password with special characters like `ZPzEjqwY^$93Qrgf2oka&VvFWSja!WmU`

## Dockge Variable awarding
* Go to `dockge` in the sidebar
* Edit this Container
* Scroll down to '.env-Area'
* Copy the variable name into it and give it a value,<br/>
as here: `"DOCKGE_EXTERNAL_IP" = https:://dockge.yourdomain.com`

* Click Save

Now we are ready to easily create further containers with additional functions.<br/>
We will go into this in more detail in the next step
