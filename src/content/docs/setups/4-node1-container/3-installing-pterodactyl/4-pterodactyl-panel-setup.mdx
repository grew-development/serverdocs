import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Create Admin-Account
To login later, we have to create a user via our Pterodactyl console.

* Open your Dockge-Manager like `dockge.yourdomain.com`
* Click on your pterodactyl panel in the left sidebar
* Under `Container > panel` click on the '>_bash'-button
* Click on 'Switch to sh'-button
* Enter `php artisan p:user:make --no-password`

<Aside type="note">
    **Explanation of the command**<br/>
    `php artisan`: This is the command to run Artisan commands, the built-in command-line tool in Laravel.

    `p:user:make`: This is a custom command defined in this Laravel project.<br/>
    The prefix p: might indicate a specific namespace or functionality that the command performs, specifically for creating users (user).

    `--no-password`: This is an option passed to the command, indicating that the user being created should not have a password set.<br/>
</Aside>

##### Question
* Is this user an administrator? (yes/no) > `yes`
* Email Address > `Write your E-Mailadress for your login`
* Username > `root` (I use `root`, but you can use the first letter of first name, then full surname separated by a period like `j.doe`)
* First Name > your first name
* Last Name > your last name

After you have confirmed your last name, you will receive a confirmation email, which you can confirm by clicking on the `Setup Your Account` button.<br/>
Now set a new personal password (Individual, 32-digit password with special characters like `ZPzEjqwY^$93Qrgf2oka&VvFWSja!WmU`) and confirm the `Reset Password` button.<br/>
You will now be automatically redirected to the Pterodactyl dashboard.
