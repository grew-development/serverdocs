## Configuring Trunks
You will have to add a new trunk each time you want to connect a new VLAN to the Docker CT. For that its simmelar to the OPNSense setup.<br/>
Run the Commands in the proxmox-shell. You can edit the config with `vim` or `nano`.
```
nano /etc/pve/lxc/201.conf
```

We will need to edit the line starting with `net0`: and add all your VLANS as trunks `trunks=...;203;...`<br/>
It should look like this after that
```
net0: name=vlan0,bridge=vmbr1,firewall=1,hwaddr=BC:24:11:1C:45:19,type=veth,trunks=202;203
```
* Safe (STRG+o) and close (STRG+x) the file
* Reboot the Node1-CT

<Aside type="caution">
    Make sure to add new VLANs to trunks when needing a new VLAN
</Aside>

## Create VLAN in OPNsense
### Connecting to OPNsense-WebUI
Open and Login to `opnsense.yourdomain.com`

### Create Interface
* Go to `Interfaces > Other Types > VLAN`
* Add VLAN by clicking the plus-button
* Enter the following values
* Hit 'safe' and then 'apply'

#### Interfacesetting
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Edit VLAN">
        Device          -   vlan0.203 ( vlan0.\<VLAN_ID> )<br/>
        Parent          -   vtnet1<br/>
        VLAN tag        -   203<br/>
        VLAN priority   -   Default<br/>
        Description     -   203_peterodactyl ( \<VLAN_ID>_\<NAME_FOR_THE_VLAN> )<br/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Adding the new interface
* Go to `Interfaces > Assignments`
* Select your new VLAN in "Assign a new interface" you just create
* Provide a description (Use the same description as above - Example: 203_peterodactyl)
* Click the `Add`-button

### Enable of the new interface
* Go to `Interfaces > [Your Interface]` (example proxy: 203_peterodactyl)
* Enable the Interface
* Select under `Generic configuration` the "IPv4 Configuration Type" from "none" to "Static IPv4"
* Enter the IP address for the Proxmox Gateway under “Static IPv4 configuration” (example pterodactyl: 10.2.3.1)
* Choose your Subnet to 24
* Hit Safe and Apply changes

### Update RFC1918-Rules
* Go to `Firewall > Aliases`
* Edit the `RFC1918-rule` by clicking the pen
* Add content `__opt7_network` (In future all those beginning with __, but the number can be different)
* Hit Safe and Apply

### Add Rule RFC1918 to Interface
We will use RFC1918 to configure firewall rules for internet access.
If you want to give internet access to a vlan but still restrict access to all other internal IPs
you can do that with the help of a firewall rule that accepts all connections except if they target RFC1918.

* Go to "Firewall > Rules"
* Select the VLAN you want to grant internet access
* Create a new rule if it doesnt already exist by hitting the plus.

We want to allow everything except if the destination is RFC1918.

* Enable Destination / Invert.
* Select RFC1918 as a destination
* Select the Category (optional)
* Safe and Apply Changes

### Add Alias for proxy
* Go to `Firewall > Aliases`
* Hit the Plus-Symbol
* Enter the name `peterodactyl_203`
* Choose type as `host(s)`
* Selected content `10.2.3.2`
* Hit Safe and Apply
