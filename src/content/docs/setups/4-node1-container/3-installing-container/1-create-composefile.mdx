Now that we have added our dockge, we can add our first container.
We do this in dockge.

## Connecting to Dockge-Web-UI
* Open and Login to `dockge.yourdomain.com`
* Click `+Compose`-Button

## Fill in the general information
Name your compose and select on which dockge it should be installed. I am using the agent Node1-Dockge-IP:5001 that I have just created. <br/>

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="General">
        Stack-Name      -   your individual name<br/>
        Dockge Agent    -   choose '10.2.2.2:5001' (Your Node1-Dockge-IP with Port 5001)<br/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Fill the DockerCompose-Area
You can then enter your docker compose file in the large container on the right-hand side.<br/>
You can use what is written there from my <a target="_blank" href="../../../configs/docker-composefiles/compose-compose-dcbotpriv">docker compose file.</a><br/>
I have also written explanations there as a comment for the individual points that you can change.<br/>

You may have to rename the names of the containers etc., the IPs and the other general settings, depending on what your bot can do.<br/>

## Fill the .env-Area
As you can see, I use variables, which I can now name or set in the Env-Area.<br/>
Here is an example:<br/>
```
#phpMyAdmin
PMA_ROOT_USER= your_root_user

#MySQL
MYSQL_ROOT_PW= your_dbase_password
```
