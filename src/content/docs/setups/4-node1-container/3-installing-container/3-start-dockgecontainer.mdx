import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Create Subdomain
I have moved this section to the <a target="_blank" href="../../../subdomains/subdomain-dbase-dcpriv">`Subdomains`</a>.<br/>
You need this step to continue with the setup as well as to log in at all.

Once you have made all the network settings and Subdomain settings, we can now start our container with dockge.<br/>
To do this, we first go to the dockge-domain `dockge.yourdomain.com` and login..

To start the container now choose the compose file you have just created.
And click `start`-Button.

If you have no errors, you can now access your database via the WebUI phpMyAdmin.
To do this, open `dbase.yourdomain.com`.
