import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Before we install our docker software, we should perform a small update.<br/>
To do this we simply use the get Docker script.

* Run `apt update`
* Run `apt upgrade -y`
* Run `apt install curl -y`
<br/>

Now you can install docker
```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh (Shows you the current installation status)
```
<br/>

You can verify the installation with `docker ps`
