Now before we create Docker and everything else, we need to make sure that our container has internet. To do this, we need to enable this in our firewall.<br/>
That's why I first create my VLAN in OPNsense and then check whether the server really has access to the internet.

## Connecting to OPNsense-WebUI
Open and Login to `opnsense.yourdomain.com`

## Create Interface
* Go to `Interfaces > Other Types > VLAN`
* Add VLAN by clicking the plus-button
* Enter the following values
* Hit 'safe' and then 'apply'

### Interfacesetting
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Edit VLAN">
        Device          -   vlan0.201 ( vlan0.\<VLAN_ID> )<br/>
        Parent          -   vtnet1<br/>
        VLAN tag        -   201<br/>
        VLAN priority   -   Default<br/>
        Description     -   201_docker ( \<VLAN_ID>_\<NAME_FOR_THE_VLAN> )<br/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Adding the new interface
* Go to `Interfaces > Assignments`
* Select your new VLAN in "Assign a new interface" you just create
* Provide a description (Use the same description as above - Example: 201_docker)
* Click the `Add`-button

## Enable of the new interface
* Go to `Interfaces > [Your Interface]` (example docker: 201_docker)
* Enable the Interface
* Select under `Generic configuration` the "IPv4 Configuration Type" from "none" to "Static IPv4"
* Enter the IP address for the Proxmox Gateway under “Static IPv4 configuration” (example docker: 10.2.1.1)
* Choose your Subnet to 24
* Hit Safe and Apply changes

## Update RFC1918-Rules
* Go to `Firewall > Aliases`
* Edit the `RFC1918-rule` by clicking the pen
* Add content `__opt6_network` (In future all those beginning with __, but the number can be different)
* Hit Safe and Apply

## Add Rule RFC1918 to Interface
We will use RFC1918 to configure firewall rules for internet access.<br/>
If you want to give internet access to the tailscale-interface but still restrict access to all other internal IPs<br/>
you can do that with the help of a firewall rule that accepts all connections except if they target RFC1918.

* Go to "Firewall > Rules"
* Select the VLAN you want to grant internet access
* Create a new rule if it doesnt already exist by hitting the plus.

We want to allow everything except if the destination is RFC1918.

* Enable Destination / Invert.
* Select RFC1918 as a destination
* Select the Category (optional)
* Safe and Apply Changes

## Disable anti-lockout-rule
* Go to "Firewall > NAT > Port Forward"
* Edit the Anti-Lockout Rule
* Scroll down to "Disable anti-lockout"
* Enable this option
* Safe changes

## Add Alias for docker
* Go to `Firewall > Aliases`
* Hit the Plus-Symbol
* Enter the name `docker_201`
* Choose type as `host(s)`
* Selected content `10.2.1.2`
* Hit Safe and Apply

## Testing Internet-Connecting
Make sure that the firewall is enabled.
* Go to your OPNSense Console
* Choose `Option 8` for open shell
* Write `pfctl -e`

Now check the connection between the firewall and the container
* Go to your OPNSense Console
* Choose `Option 8` for open shell
* Write `ping 10.2.1.2` > Result is send every second like "64 bytes from 10.2.1.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.343 ms"
<br/>
* Go to your Docker CT Console
* Start the CT via clicking by 'start'-button in the top of the console
* Wait a moment until you can log in
<br/>
If these results are positive, we can now also enter the following in our Docker CT Console
* Write `ping 1.1.1.1` > Result is send every second like "64 bytes from 1.1.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=6.15 ms"
<br/>
If everything is now correct and working, you can now continue with the installation
