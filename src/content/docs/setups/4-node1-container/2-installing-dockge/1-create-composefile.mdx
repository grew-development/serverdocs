## Connecting to Proxmox-Web-UI
* Open `proxmox.yourdomain.com`
* Go to the Node1 CT-console

## Create DockerCompose-file
We create a new folder called “dockge” in /opt/stacks.<br/>
```
mkdir /opt/stacks/
mkdir /opt/stacks/dockge
```

We will now create our docker-compose.yml file in it. We open this straight away with the command “nano” or “vim”<br/>
```
cd /opt/stacks/dockge/
nano docker-compose.yml
```

You can see what is written there from my <a target="_blank" href="../../../configs/docker-composefiles/compose-dockge">docker compose file</a>.<br/>
I have also written explanations there as a comment for the individual points that you can change.
