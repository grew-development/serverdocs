Tailscale is a VPN like software that allows you to create virtual network between your devices.
It also allows for simple in Browser SSH and Exit Node creation if you want to use your server as a VPN aswell.
It also has a lot of other usefull features like file sharing and much more.

<Aside type="note">
This step is optional.<br/>
However, I recommend this step because it allows secure and private access to your services or servers without opening any ports.
You can also use it to access your devices from anywhere in the world for debugging purposes.

## Installing Tailscale
Tailscale is sadly not directly available as a plugin.<br/>
But its still rather simple to install. I mainly followed the official Tailscale guide which isn’t 100% correct at the moment.

First of all, we should download more ports for OPNSense.<br/>
* Go to your  OPNSense Console
* Choose `Option 8` for open shell
* Wirte `opnsense-code ports` (the download may take some time now)

Now we have to go to our tailscale folder to start the installation there

* Open your Tailscale-Folder with `cd /usr/ports/security/tailscale`
* Write `make install` (This will take a few minutes depending on the CPU performance)

Now everything should be installed and we can now start a tailscale demon as well as execute tailscale.

* `service tailscaled enable`
* `service tailscaled start`

To test whether Tailscale has actually started, we can enter `tailscale version`.<br/>
If everything has now worked, we can now connect to our Tailscale account.
