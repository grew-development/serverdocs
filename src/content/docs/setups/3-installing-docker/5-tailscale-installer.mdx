<Aside type="note">
    We now know why I installed Tailsclae. But on the docker container I use Tailscale to get FTP access.
</Aside>

## Installing Tailscale
* Open `https://tailscale.com/download/linux`
* Copy the command in your clipboard
* Go to your Docker CT Console
* Run the command from your clipboard



## Connect Tailscale
When the installation is complete, you only need to execute the following command. Now select how you want to connect Tailscale to your Docker-CT.<br/>
There are four different options.

1. `tailscale up` > Execute this command to establish the simple connection.
2. `tailscale up --ssh` > This will allow you to establish an SSH connection via tailscale (my choice)
3. `tailscale up --advertise-exit-node` > Run this command to use OPNsense as VPN or Exit Node
4. `tailscale up --ssh --advertise-exit-node` > Establish tailscale with SSH connection and exit node

After you have entered your name, a link like "https://login.tailscale.com/a/RANDOMNUMBER" will appear.

Enter this into the browser to log in to Tailscale.<br/>
Your OPNsense will now automatically be added to your tailscale, as soon as you have confirmed everything you will automatically be taken to your machines.

Congratulations, you can now connect to your Docker CT with FTP via your Tailscale address

### Connection error 
If an error occurs that tailscale cannot be started, you must first perform the following steps.<br/>
However, these are also officially linked by tailscale.

/>

Nevertheless, I will explain the steps to you now
* Go to your proxmox Console
* run `nano /etc/pve/lxc/101.conf` (the number changes depending on which CT-Id you use)
* add at the end:
```
lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 10:200 rwm
lxc.mount.entry: /dev/net/tun dev/net/tun none bind,create=file
``` 
* Safe (STRG+o) and close (STRG+x) the file
* Reboot the CT

Now you can repeat the [Connect Tailscale](#connect-tailscale) steps!
