import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Start by creating a new CT in proxmox.<br/>
I used VM ID 101 to display it at the top because its the first entry point for every request to the server.
Later I also assign VLAN101 to the opnsense.

Click on the `Create CT` button above and set the LXC Container with the following values.<br/>
I left all values that were not specified as they were or were not specified at the time of creation.

<Aside type="tip">
    Activate Advanced Mode at the bottom of the window
</Aside>

### CT Settingvalues
After creating the CT we will add the vlan network aswell.<br/>
Now confirm the whole thing in the `Confirm area` and click on the `finish` button.<br/>
Please be patient for a moment until the CT is finished and "TASK OK" is displayed in the output console.

## Post-Create
Now we will activate the `Start at Boot` Option.<br/>
To do this, we proceed as follows:
* Open your container (CT ID 101)
* Go to `Options > Start at Boot`
* Change to True
