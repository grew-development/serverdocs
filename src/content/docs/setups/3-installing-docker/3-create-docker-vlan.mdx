Now before we create Docker and everything else, we need to make sure that our container has internet.
To do this, we need to enable this in our firewall.

That's why I first create my VLAN in OPNsense and then check whether the server really has access to the internet.

## Connecting to OPNsense-WebUI
You can connect to OPNSense via a SSH-Tunnel.

* Open Windows Terminal
* Use the command: `ssh root@<yourIP4> -L 443:<WAN_IP4>:443`

This will open up a tunnel. After that you should be able to connect via `https://localhost`.
To setup everything important I recommend running the setup wizard. It will configure some important things needed for further configuration

<Aside>
If you cannot reach the OPNSense make sure that the firewall is disabled in OPNSense.

You can do so from Proxmox in the OPNSense console by selecting option 8.<br/>
In the OPNSense console you can then type `pfctl -d` to disable the firewall.<br/>
It will reenable after each apply you do inside of the OPNSense WebUI or by running `pfctl -e`.
All Rules will be disabled when the firewall is disabled. If every you can’t reach OPNSense on the
tunnel or you need to trubbleshoot make sure to disable the firewall again.<br/>

THIS WILL HAPPEN A LOT DURING SETUP!
</Aside>

In the WebUI you can login to your OPNSense with the password you selected during installation or<br/>
the default password `opnsense` if you did not configure a password during installation.<br/>
The Username is `root`

## Create Interface
* Go to `Interfaces > Other Types > VLAN`
* Add VLAN by clicking the plus-button
* Enter the following values
* Hit 'safe' and then 'apply'

### Interfacesetting
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Edit VLAN">
        Device          -   vlan0.101 ( vlan0.\<VLAN_ID> )<br/>
        Parent          -   vtnet1<br/>
        VLAN tag        -   101<br/>
        VLAN priority   -   Default<br/>
        Description     -   101_docker ( \<VLAN_ID>_\<NAME_FOR_THE_VLAN> )<br/>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Adding the new interface
* Go to `Interfaces > Assignments`
* Select your new VLAN in "Assign a new interface" you just create
* Provide a description (Use the same description as above - Example: 101_docker)
* Click the `Add`-button

## Enable of the new interface
* Go to `Interfaces > [Your Interface]` (example docker: 101_docker)
* Enable the Interface
* Select under `Generic configuration` the "IPv4 Configuration Type" from "none" to "Static IPv4"
* Enter the IP address for the Proxmox Gateway under “Static IPv4 configuration” (example docker: 10.1.1.1)
* Choose your Subnet to 24
* Hit Safe and Apply changes

## Update RFC1918-Rules
* Go to `Firewall > Aliases`
* Edit the `RFC1918-rule` by clicking the pen
* Add content `__opt1_network` (In future all those beginning with __)
* Hit Safe and Apply

## Add Rule RFC1918 to Interface
We will use RFC1918 to configure firewall rules for internet access.
If you want to give internet access to a vlan but still restrict access to all other internal IPs
you can do that with the help of a firewall rule that accepts all connections except if they target RFC1918.

* Go to "Firewall > Rules"
* Select the VLAN you want to grant internet access
* Create a new rule if it doesnt already exist by hitting the plus.

We want to allow everything except if the destination is RFC1918.

* Enable Destination / Invert.
* Select RFC1918 as a destination
* Select the Category (optional)
* Safe and Apply Changes

## Disable anti-lockout-rule
* Go to "Firewall > NAT > Port Forward"
* Edit the Anti-Lockout Rule
* Scroll down to "Disable anti-lockout"
* Enable this option
* Safe changes

## Add Alias for docker
* Go to `Firewall > Aliases`
* Hit the Plus-Symbol
* Enter the name `docker`
* Choose type as `host(s)`
* Selected content `10.1.1.2`
* Hit Safe and Apply

## Testing Internet-Connecting
Make sure that the firewall is enabled.
* Go to your OPNSense Console
* Choose `Option 8` for open shell
* Write `pfctl -e`

Now check the connection between the firewall and the container
* Go to your OPNSense Console
* Choose `Option 8` for open shell
* Write `ping 10.1.1.2` > Result is send every second like "64 bytes from 10.1.1.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.343 ms"
<br/>
* Go to your Docker CT Console
* Start the CT via clicking by 'start'-button in the top of the console
* Wait a moment until you can log in
* Write `ping 10.1.1.1` > Result is send every second like "64 bytes from 10.1.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.343 ms"
<br/>
If these results are positive, we can now also enter the following in our Docker CT Console
* Write `ping 1.1.1.1` > Result is send every second like "64 bytes from 1.1.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=6.15 ms"
<br/>
If everything is now correct and working, you can now continue with the installation
