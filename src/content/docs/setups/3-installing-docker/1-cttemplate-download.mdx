Now I install my Docker software on my own CT (container) instead of a VM (virtual machine). First of all, I need a template, which I have to download.

I used Debian Bullseye as the base template because Proxmox was already running on it and so you have the same operating system everywhere.<br/>
To get the CT template, do the following.

## Download via Templates
* Open your Proxmox WebUI
* Go to `Local > CT Templates`
* Click the `Templates`-Button
* Choose and downloaded "Debian-11-Standard" with the Description "[...]Bullseye[...]"
* Wait until it says “TASK OK” and close the window

## Download via Debian Link
Manual will be available soon
