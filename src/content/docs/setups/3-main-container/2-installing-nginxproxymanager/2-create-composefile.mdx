We create a new folder called “nginx-proxy-manager” in /opt/stacks.<br/>
```
mkdir nginx-proxy-manager
```

We will now create our docker-compose.yml file in it. We open this straight away with the command “nano” or “vim”<br/>
```
cd nginx-proxy-manager/
nano docker-compose.yml
```

You can see what is written there from my <a target="_blank" href="../../../configs/docker-composefiles/compose-nginx">docker compose file</a>.<br/>
I have also written explanations there as a comment for the individual points that you can change.
